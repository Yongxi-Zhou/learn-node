- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

First, we start by executing foo(2). Then put bar(2) into the pending callback. Next, we execute baz().
Then, we execute foo(1). Then put bar(1) into the pending callback. Next, we execute baz().
After the last execution in the main thread completes, it starts executing the tasks in the event loop. That is, bar(2) and bar(1).
So, the output is as follows:
foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar
