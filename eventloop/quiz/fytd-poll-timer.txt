- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
SomeAsyncOperation is a IO operation, which is a macro task. The setTimeout is also a macro task.
Both of them are put in event loop in the macro task callback queue. And someAsyncOperation executed first and then setTimeout.


- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
No. Because the order of execution defined in the function isn't changed.

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
Yes. timeout takes less time that IO event.
